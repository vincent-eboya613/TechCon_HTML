<p>Tech conBuild is Microsoft's premier annual developer conference, first launched in 2011 as a successor to the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) and MIX events. The first Build conference was held in Anaheim, California, and marked a significant shift for Microsoft as it introduced Windows 8 and the new Metro UI, which laid the foundation for a touch-friendly interface. This conference set the tone for future Build events, focusing on Microsoft’s evolving platforms and development tools.

    In the following years, Build continued to expand its scope. The 2012 conference, held on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, highlighted updates to Windows 8 and introduced Windows Phone 8, showcasing Microsoft's commitment to a unified platform for developers. By 2013, the conference had grown in prominence, spotlighting the release of Windows 8.1 and further integration with the Azure cloud platform, signaling Microsoft's pivot towards cloud computing and cross-platform compatibility.
    
    From 2014 to 2016, Microsoft Build began to emphasize a broader ecosystem that included not only Windows but also the emerging technologies of Azure, Office, and Microsoft’s various AI and machine learning tools. This era saw the introduction of significant innovations like the Cortana digital assistant, the HoloLens mixed reality device, and .NET Core, which allowed developers to build apps across different operating systems. The conference became a platform for unveiling new updates to Visual Studio and a hub for developers to explore the potential of Microsoft’s expanding toolset.
    
    Microsoft Build has since evolved into a key event for developers worldwide, showcasing the latest advancements in software, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies. It serves as a pivotal moment each year where Microsoft sets its technological agenda, highlighting how developers can leverage Microsoft’s platforms to build the next generation of applications.</p>
